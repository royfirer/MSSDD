# MSSDD
Marble Slab Surface Defect Detection(MSSDD), a multi-resolution dataset specifically designed for few-shot defect detection and segmentation in marble slab surfaces.

Since the collected dataset is sourced from a collaborating stone processing enterprise, the issue of data version requires further negotiation. Currently, we only provide a small dataset, and the full dataset will be offered after the negotiation is completed.
